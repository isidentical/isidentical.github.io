            <p>I'm close to graduating from high school (2021, june) and I am looking for
            international scholarships and grants for universites that are in the USA 
            / Canada / Europe.</p>
            <p>I have also limited (very limited) free time for freelance offers but if you
            are willing to sponsor some work to an open source project that is with in my area
            area of interest (AST, parsing, static analyzing), there is no technical time limit
            except the school period.</p>

            <p>I'm trying to work on open source full time (except the school period),
            especially on the CPython project. But I have a various of contributions
            to other projects such as Astor, Django, Setuptools, Pyflakes, Pegen, RustPython,
            Werkzeug and many more small contribution.</p>

                               built-in handlers (like finding yield statements that can be replaced with yield from). But the 
                               real aim is using its framework side, developing codebase-specific plugins.</p>

                constructed tokens with matching them according to created patterns, put new tokens and modify the lexer rules, refactor 
                tons of python files without losing any information (full roundtripability).</p>
